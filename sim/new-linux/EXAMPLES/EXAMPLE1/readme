EXAMPLE 1 - README file

This example shows a very simple way of using Khepera simulator. It makes use
of a simple control algorithm and exhibits some graphic capabilities. This
might be a good starting point if you want to develop your own Khepera
controller because you will understand how to read the inputs and write the
outputs to the robot.

How to run it ?

            do                                                 type

1) run install shell script:                             install_example1
   this will install the directory USER
   and the file makefile.

2) go back to SIM directory:                                  cd ../..
3) run the makefile:                                           make
4) eventually edit the .simrc file or the makefile
5) when everything is all right:                               sim &
6) eventually make modifications

7) if you want to remove this example,                  cd EXAMPLES/EXAMPLE1
   run the remove_example1 shell script:                   remove_example1
