EXAMPLE 2 - README file

This example shows how it is possible to implement a neural network as a
controller for the simulated / real Khepera robot. It also features an
interesting way to display graphs (for example the path of the robot) using
gnuplot with a pipe from the simulator. Although the program is written in C,
it may be compiled using g++ to show that C++ programmers will have no problems
compiling and linking their C++ sources. Don't forget to do a "make clean"
before recompiling with g++ !

How to run it ?

            do                                                 type

1) run install shell script:                             install_example2
   this will install the following directories:

   USER
   GNUPLOT
   STATS
   NEURAL

   and files

   makefile
   ROBOT/big.robot
   ROBOT/learning.robot

2) go back to SIM directory:                                  cd ../..
3) run the makefile:                                           make
4) eventually edit the .simrc file or the makefile
5) when everything is all right:                               sim &
6) try some new neural.network
7) eventually make modifications

8) if you want to remove this example,                 cd EXAMPLES/EXAMPLE2
   run the remove_example2 shell script:                 remove_example2
