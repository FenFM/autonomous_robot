EXAMPLE 0 - README file

This example contains the minimal almost empty user files necessary for
compiling Khepera simulator. If you want to write your own controller for the
Khepera robot, you can fill in the empty areas with your own C code. If you
run example 0 without modifying it, the robot will remain stuck because it has
no controller ! However, everything else should work...

How to run it ?

            do                                                 type

1) run install shell script:                             install_example0
   this will install the directory USER
   and the file makefile.

2) go back to SIM directory:                                  cd ../..
3) run the makefile:                                           make
4) eventually edit the .simrc file or the makefile
5) when everything is all right:                               sim &
6) eventually make modifications

7) if you want to remove this example,                  cd EXAMPLES/EXAMPLE0
   run the remove_example0 shell script:                   remove_example0
