EXAMPLE 3 - README file

This example shows how it is possible to implement multi-agent simulation with
the Khepera Simulator.
It makes use of the source files multirobots.c and multirobots.h. These files
are placed in the directory CONTRIB.
You have to define some functions in the same way you do with the simple
simulator (see the manual for more details). In order to do that, you have to
implement two specific functions:

	boolean FastStepMultiRobots(struct MultiRobots *multi);
	boolean StepMultiRobots(struct MultiRobots *multi);

The group of robot is viewed like a single entity: a structure MultiRobots. 
First, you have to create this entity with the function CreateMultiRobots
(defined in multirobots.c). This function receives the number of robots of the
group as a parameter.

The functions MultiRobotRun and MultiRobotRunFast (defined in
CONTRIB/multirobots.c) make use of the functions StepMultiRobots and
FastStepMultiRobots to run all the robots of the group. To define the
behaviors of the robots, you must fill in the functions StepMultiRobots (and /
or FastStepMultiRobots) in USER/user.c. You can see how I did all this in the
file EXAMPLES/EXAMPLE3/user.c . The robots are synchonous, that is they move
one after another. If you need asynchronous motion, you have to implement your
own functions MultiRobotRun and MultiRobotRunFast.

The functions StepMultiRobots and  FastStepMultiRobots allow you to have
different behavior for each robots. In order to do this, just implement
several functions StepRobot-like, and call them according to the current robot
being moving. See the file multirobots.h for more details on functions.
The multi-agent package operates only on simulated Khepera robots. Further
version will provide an extension to operate on real Khepera robots.

How to run it ?

            do                                                 type

1) run install shell script:                             install_example3
2) go back to SIM directory:                                  cd ../..
3) run the makefile:                                           make
4) eventually edit the .simrc file or the makefile
5) when everything is all right:                               sim &
6) a. click on the "command" button
   b. type "test"
   c. observe the robots moving in the world
7) eventually make modifications

8) if you want to remove this example,                 cd EXAMPLES/EXAMPLE2
   run the remove_example2 shell script:                 remove_example2
