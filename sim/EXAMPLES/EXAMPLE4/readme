EXAMPLE 4 - README file

This example shows how to use Khepera Simulator as if it was a real Khepera
drive by serial port commands. Two pipes (for input and output) are opened by
sim to communicate with the user program (which is called serial in this
example). To run this example, you need to run Khepera Simulator with the -p
flag (pipe), sim will open the two pipes. Then run serial program and press
the run button in sim. The two programs are going to synchronize through the
pipe files. You can now type serial commands in serial, they will be sent to
sim and the answer of sim will be displayed to serial stdout. The source file
serial.c will teach you how to drive sim using the standard Khepera serial
commands. The serial commands implemented in sim are described in the appendix
of this readme file.

How to run it ?

            do                                                 type

1) run install shell script:                             install_example4
   this will install the directory USER
   and the file makefile.

2) go back to SIM directory:                                  cd ../..
3) run the makefile:                                      make sim serial
4) eventually edit the .simrc file or the makefile
5) when everything is all right:                               sim -p&
6) then run serial                                             serial
7) Send commands (such as O N or D,-10,10)

8) if you want to remove this example,                  cd EXAMPLES/EXAMPLE4
   run the remove_example4 shell script:                   remove_example4


Appendix: Khepera Serial Commands
---------

A  Configure (not implemented)

B  Read software version (not implemented)

D  Set speed
Format of the command:  D, speed_motor_left, speed_motor_right<\n>
Format of the response: d<\n>
Effect:                 Set the speed of the two motors. The unit is the
                        pulse/10 ms that correspond to 8 millimeters per
                        second on the real robot.

E  Read speed
Format of the command:  E</n>
Format of the response: e, speed_motor_left, speed_motor_right<\n>
Effect:                 Read the instantaneous speed of the two motors. The
                        unit is the pulse/10 ms that correspond to 8
                        millimeters per second on the real robot.

G  Set position (not implemented)

H  Read position (not implemented)

N  Read proximity sensors
Format of the command:  N</n>
Format of the response: n, val_sens_left_90,val_sens_left_45,val_sens_left_10,
                        val_sens_right_10,val_sens_right_45,val_sens_right_90,
                        val_sens_back_right,val_sens_back_left<\n>
Effect:                 Read the 10 bit values of the 8 proximity sensors, from
                        the front sensor situated at the left of the robot,
                        turning clockwise to the back-left sensor.

O  Read ambient light sensors
Format of the command:  O</n>
Format of the response: o, val_sens_left_90,val_sens_left_45,val_sens_left_10,
                        val_sens_right_10,val_sens_right_45,val_sens_right_90,
                        val_sens_back_right,val_sens_back_left<\n>
Effect:                 Read the 10 bit values of the 8 ambient light sensors,
                        from the front sensor situated at the left of the
                        robot, turning clockwise to the back-left sensor.
